# Task description

Introduction
Add the numbers to a minesweeper board.

Minesweeper is a popular game where the user has to find the mines using numeric hints that indicate how many mines are directly adjacent (horizontally, vertically, diagonally) to a square.

In this exercise you have to create some code that counts the number of mines adjacent to a square and transforms boards like this (where * indicates a mine):

    +-----+
    | * * |
    |  *  |
    |  *  |
    |     |
    +-----+
into this:

    +-----+
    |1*3*1|
    |13*31|
    | 2*2 |
    | 111 |
    +-----+
    
# How to use

Enter `ruby main.rb -h` for details
    
Enter `ruby main.rb <full path name>` to arrange numbers on the board
